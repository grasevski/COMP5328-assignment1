# COMP5328-assignment1
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Algorithms.

Dependencies:
 - LaTex
 - python3: `pip install matplotlib scikit-learn`

Run `make` to build, or run `./algorithm.py` to just run the code. It will write the summarized results to stdout in csv format, as well as saving comprehensive results to `results.csv` and saving the reconstructed images to a `figures` directory. Graphs can also be generated from the summarized results by using the `-g` flag. See `./algorithm.py -h` for more info.
